    <h1>NAME</h1>
    <p>git-config - Get and set repository or global options</p>

    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>

    <p>
        You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command. The name is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value will be escaped.

        Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the --add option. If you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple lines, a value-pattern (which is an extended regular expression, unless the --fixed-value option is given) needs to be given. Only the existing values that match the pattern are updated or unset. If you want to handle the lines that do not match the pattern, just prepend a single exclamation mark in front (see also EXAMPLES), but note that this only works when the --fixed-value option is not in use.
    </p>

    <h1>OPTIONS</h1>
    <p>
        <p>
            <code>--replace-all</code> Default behavior is to replace at most one line. This replaces all lines matching the key (and optionally the value-pattern).
        </p>

        <p>
            <code>--add</code> Adds a new line to the option without altering any existing values. This is the same as providing ^$ as the value-pattern in --replace-all.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <code>--get</code> Get the value for a given key (optionally filtered by a regex matching the value). Returns error code 1 if the key was not found and the last value if multiple key values were found.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <code>--get-all</code> Like get, but returns all values for a multi-valued key.
        </p>
