    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the
        changes. The new commit is a direct child of HEAD, usually the tip of the current branch, and the branch is
        updated to point to it (unless no branch is associated with the working tree, in which case HEAD is "detached"
        as described in git-checkout[1]).

        The content to be committed can be specified in several ways:

        by using git-add[1] to incrementally "add" changes to the index before using the commit command (Note: even
        modified files must be "added");

        by using git-rm[1] to remove files from the working tree and the index, again before using the commit command;

        by listing files as arguments to the commit command (without --interactive or --patch switch), in which case the
        commit will ignore changes staged in the index, and instead record the current content of the listed files
        (which must already be known to Git);

        by using the -a switch with the commit command to automatically "add" changes from all known files (i.e. all
        files that are already listed in the index) and to automatically "rm" files in the index that have been removed
        from the working tree, and then perform the actual commit;

        by using the --interactive or --patch switches with the commit command to decide one by one which files or hunks
        should be part of the commit in addition to contents in the index, before finalizing the operation. See the
        “Interactive Mode” section of git-add[1] to learn how to operate these modes.

        The --dry-run option can be used to obtain a summary of what is included by any of the above for the next commit
        by giving the same set of parameters (options and paths).

        If you make a commit and then find a mistake immediately after that, you can recover from it with git reset.</p>

    <h3>OPTIONS</h3>
    <p>-a
        --all
        Tell the command to automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, but new files you have not
        told Git about are not affected.

        -p
        --patch
        Use the interactive patch selection interface to choose which changes to commit. See git-add[1] for details.

        -C <commit>
            --reuse-message=<commit>
                Take an existing commit object, and reuse the log message and the authorship information (including the
                timestamp) when creating the commit.

                -c <commit>
                    --reedit-message=<commit>
                        Like -C, but with -c the editor is invoked, so that the user can further edit the commit
                        message.</p>
