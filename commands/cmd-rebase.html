    <h1>Name</h1>
    <p>git-rebase - Reapply commits on top of another base tip</p>

    <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
    <p>
        <code>
            git rebase [-i | --interactive] [<options>] [--exec <cmd>]
                [--onto <newbase> | --keep-base] [<upstream> [<branch>]]
            git rebase [-i | --interactive] [<options>] [--exec <cmd>] [--onto <newbase>]
                --root [<branch>]
            git rebase (--continue | --skip | --abort | --quit | --edit-todo | --show-current-patch)
        </code>
    </p>

    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <p>If <branch> is specified, git rebase will perform an automatic git switch <branch> before doing anything else. Otherwise it remains on the current branch.

        If <upstream> is not specified, the upstream configured in branch.<name>.remote and branch.<name>.merge options will be used (see git-config[1] for details) and the --fork-point option is assumed. If you are currently not on any branch or if the current branch does not have a configured upstream, the rebase will abort.
        
        All changes made by commits in the current branch but that are not in <upstream> are saved to a temporary area. This is the same set of commits that would be shown by git log <upstream>..HEAD; or by git log 'fork_point'..HEAD, if --fork-point is active (see the description on --fork-point below); or by git log HEAD, if the --root option is specified.
        
        The current branch is reset to <upstream> or <newbase> if the --onto option was supplied. This has the exact same effect as git reset --hard <upstream> (or <newbase>). ORIG_HEAD is set to point at the tip of the branch before the reset.</p>

    <h3>MODE OPTIONS</h3>
    <p>The options in this section cannot be used with any other option, including not with each other:

        --continue
        Restart the rebasing process after having resolved a merge conflict.
        
        --skip
        Restart the rebasing process by skipping the current patch.
        
        --abort
        Abort the rebase operation and reset HEAD to the original branch. If <branch> was provided when the rebase operation was started, then HEAD will be reset to <branch>. Otherwise HEAD will be reset to where it was when the rebase operation was started.
        
        --quit
        Abort the rebase operation but HEAD is not reset back to the original branch. The index and working tree are also left unchanged as a result. If a temporary stash entry was created using --autostash, it will be saved to the stash list.
        
        --edit-todo
        Edit the todo list during an interactive rebase.
        
        --show-current-patch
        Show the current patch in an interactive rebase or when rebase is stopped because of conflicts. This is the equivalent of git show REBASE_HEAD.</p>
