    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the
        cloned repository (visible using git branch --remotes), and creates and checks out an initial branch that
        is forked from the cloned repositoryâ€™s currently active branch.

        After the clone, a plain git fetch without arguments will update all the remote-tracking branches,
        and a git pull without arguments will in addition merge the remote master branch into the current master
        branch, if any (this is untrue when "--single-branch" is given; see below).

        This default configuration is achieved by creating references to the remote branch heads under
        refs/remotes/origin and by initializing remote.origin.url and remote.origin.fetch configuration variables.
    <h3>OPTIONS</h3>
    <p>--no-hardlinks - Force the cloning process from a repository on a local filesystem to copy the files under
        the .git/objects directory instead of using hardlinks. This may be desirable if you are trying to make
        a back-up of your repository.

        -q, --quiet - Operate quietly. Progress is not reported to the standard error stream.


        -v, --verbose - Run verbosely. Does not affect the reporting of progress status to the standard error stream.

        --progress - Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when it is attached to a
        terminal, unless --quiet is specified. This flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is
        not directed to a terminal.
