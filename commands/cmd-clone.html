    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the
        cloned repository (visible using git branch --remotes), and creates and checks out an initial branch that
        is forked from the cloned repository’s currently active branch.

        After the clone, a plain git fetch without arguments will update all the remote-tracking branches,
        and a git pull without arguments will in addition merge the remote master branch into the current master
        branch, if any (this is untrue when "--single-branch" is given; see below).

        This default configuration is achieved by creating references to the remote branch heads under
        refs/remotes/origin and by initializing remote.origin.url and remote.origin.fetch configuration variables.
    <h3>OPTIONS</h3>
    <p>-l, --local - When the repository to clone from is on a local machine, this flag bypasses the normal
        "Git aware" transport mechanism and clones the repository by making a copy of HEAD and everything under
        objects and refs directories. The files under .git/objects/ directory are hardlinked to save space when possible.

        If the repository is specified as a local path (e.g., /path/to/repo), this is the default, and --local
        is essentially a no-op. If the repository is specified as a URL, then this flag is ignored (and we never
        use the local optimizations). Specifying --no-local will override the default when /path/to/repo is given,
        using the regular Git transport instead.

        If the repository’s $GIT_DIR/objects has symbolic links or is a symbolic link, the clone will fail.
        This is a security measure to prevent the unintentional copying of files by dereferencing the symbolic links.

        NOTE: this operation can race with concurrent modification to the source repository, similar to running cp -r
        src dst while modifying src.

        --no-hardlinks - Force the cloning process from a repository on a local filesystem to copy the files under
        the .git/objects directory instead of using hardlinks. This may be desirable if you are trying to make
        a back-up of your repository.

        -q, --quiet - Operate quietly. Progress is not reported to the standard error stream.

        -v, --verbose - Run verbosely. Does not affect the reporting of progress status to the standard error stream.

        --progress - Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when it is attached to a
        terminal, unless --quiet is specified. This flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is
        not directed to a terminal.

        -s, --shared - When the repository to clone is on the local machine, instead of using hard links,
        automatically setup .git/objects/info/alternates to share the objects with the source repository.
        The resulting repository starts out without any object of its own.

        NOTE: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do not use it unless you understand what it does.
        If you clone your repository using this option and then delete branches (or use any other Git command
        that makes any existing commit unreferenced) in the source repository, some objects may become unreferenced
        (or dangling). These objects may be removed by normal Git operations (such as git commit) which automatically
        call git maintenance run --auto. (See git-maintenance[1].) If these objects are removed and were referenced
        by the cloned repository, then the cloned repository will become corrupt.

        Note that running git repack without the --local option in a repository cloned with --shared will copy
        objects from the source repository into a pack in the cloned repository, removing the disk space savings
        of clone --shared. It is safe, however, to run git gc, which uses the --local option by default.

        If you want to break the dependency of a repository cloned with --shared on its source repository,
        you can simply run git repack -a to copy all objects from the source repository into a pack in the
        cloned repository.

    <h3>GIT URLS</h3>
    <p>
In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.

Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp, and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and deprecated; do not use it).

The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and should be used with caution on unsecured networks.

The following syntaxes may be used with them:

    ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

    git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

    http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

    ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

    [user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/

This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a colon. For example the local path foo:bar could be specified as an absolute path or ./foo:bar to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.

The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username expansion:

    ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

    git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

    [user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following syntaxes may be used:

    /path/to/repo.git/

    file:///path/to/repo.git/

These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except the former implies --local option.

git clone, git fetch and git pull, but not git push, will also accept a suitable bundle file. See git-bundle[1].

When Git doesn’t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it attempts to use the remote-transport remote helper, if one exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax may be used:

    transport::address

where address may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked. See gitremote-helpers[7] for details.

If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration section of the form:

	[url "actual url base"]
		insteadOf = other url base

For example, with this:

	[url "git://git.host.xz/"]
		insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
		insteadOf = work:

a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a configuration section of the form:

	[url "actual url base"]
		pushInsteadOf = other url base

For example, with this:

	[url "ssh://example.org/"]
		pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/

a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to "ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls will still use the original URL.

	<h3>CONFIGURATION</h3>
	<p>
		

Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the git-config[1] documentation. The content is the same as what’s found there:

init.templateDir

    Specify the directory from which templates will be copied. (See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of git-init[1].)
init.defaultBranch

    Allows overriding the default branch name e.g. when initializing a new repository.
clone.defaultRemoteName

    The name of the remote to create when cloning a repository. Defaults to origin, and can be overridden by passing the --origin command-line option to git-clone[1].
clone.rejectShallow

    Reject to clone a repository if it is a shallow one, can be overridden by passing option --reject-shallow in command line. See git-clone[1]
